# MobWeb_CustomSignupField
While studying Magento I found that the easiest way for me personally to learn something new is to break everything down into smaller parts. This extension is such a "smaller part". It doesn't really add any value and can't be used directly, instead it can help to provide an overview about how a task is accomplished in Magento. See my [other repositories](https://github.com/mobweb?tab=repositories) for more such example extensions.

## Description
Magento extension that adds a custom signup field to the signup form. This field is the visible in the admin panel in the customer account information tab.

## Installation

Install using [colinmollenhour/modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman/).

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
